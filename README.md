# README #

Various scripts that will improve your Mac OS X enabled computer. Some of the scripts will make your computer run faster, some other will make it a little less of a spy.

# Script List #

`st_tr_dwn.sh` - Show and delete the history of downloads for your computer.

`mac_spoofer.sh` - Spoof the MAC address of any local interface.

# Help #

Every script contains a typical **usage** printout that will explain you how
to use each script, just execute `./<script> help` to see it.

# Known Issues

`mac_spoofer.sh` is not working perfectly. Sometimes you might need to run the
script a few times until your mac address is spoofed. It seems that Mac OS X
does not accept any kind of data in the mac address.
